qr code is index.html and the blog post is index2.html

What challenges did you face when refactoring your code to use Bootstrap?
How did using Bootstrap utility classes and components simplify your styling process?
In what scenarios might you choose not to use Bootstrap and write custom CSS instead?

1. The biggest challenges I faced were knowing what I could actually use in bootstrap and what needed to stay as css as shown with the blog post and the link hover css that stayed but was put at the top of my html file instead of a seperate css file. Along with this was also all the short hand that bootstrap uses for example knowing that m-3 creates a margin that is "3" wide on a scale for bootstrap but exactly how that corresponds to the 23 px margins I had before was hard to figure out
2. It just took out a lot of typing and I'm pretty sure I couldv'e taken out some divs that I had as they were redundant but I was worried about taking anything out because it might break my page. overall it created less work.
3. I think custom css is really good for super specific things, as I said with the m-3 its only on a 6 option scale so if you wanted say 3.2 or a 5.6 its harder to get that exact measurement. There might be a way to be that exact on bootstrap but as of now I think it might be easier to just do that with css.
